# vImage
The vImage Vue Image Gallery

One day I was thinking "I am going to go find a super simple image gallery so I can post pictures of my cats, plants, and whatnot..."  Imagine my surprise when my resulting searches turned up few viable candidates.  Most of the other image galleries I found were overly complicated for my needs, not sufficiently responsive, or otherwise not what I was looking for.

So I of course decided to come up with my own solution.  I started with a variety of tutorials and have ended up with what is included in this repository.  I plan on working on it as time permits. It's *very* early in development - It's basically a Vue Front End that reads a JSON file at this point.

## Current Version
You can view the 0.02 version of vImage at [vImage.net](https://vimage.net/)

### Ideas

##### Backend
- FastAPI or simple Axios backend
- Add Auth
- Add Upload
- Admin Area

##### Front End
- Upgrade to Vue 3
- Improve user drop down menu while keeping it as simple as possible
- prettify, lint, etc for consistent code
- ~~Pagination implimentiation~~ 

So stay tuned and feel free to [let me know if you would like to help](https://twitter.com/aiggdev) work on vImage Gallery.
