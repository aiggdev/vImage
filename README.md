The vImage Vue Image Gallery

One day I was thinking "I am going to go find a super simple Vue image gallery so I can post pictures of my cats, plants, and whatnot..."  Imagine my surprise when my resulting searches turned up few viable candidates.  Most of the other image galleries I found were overly complicated for my needs, not sufficiently responsive, or otherwise not what I was looking for.

So I of course decided to come up with my own solution.  I started with a variety of tutorials and have ended up with what is included in this repository.  I plan on working on it as time permits. It's *very* early in development - I still need to add some basics:

### Ideas

- Add Auth
- Add Upload
- Vue 3
- Admin Area
- Improve user drop down menu while keeping it as simple as possible

So stay tuned and feel free to let me kow if you would like to help work on vImage Gallery.
